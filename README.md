# Horner Bible Reading Plan Generator

## Forward

This script is a heavily-modified version of Jake Price's [script](https://github.com/jakeprice-me/horner-bible-reading-plan-generator).

## Overview

This script generates a list of daily or yearly readings for the Horner Bible Reading Plan. You can read more about this reading plan [here](./horner_bible_reading_plan.pdf). 

The plan recommends using physical bookmarks in your bible, and moving each bookmark through each list as you progress. Personally I don't bother with the bookmarks and instead prefer a list I can work through and check off. If you've ever come across this plan before however (perhaps in a bible app), you'll find that once you go past the first year, you'll struggle to find any resources for the second year and onwards. So, this script aims to fix that and provide readers with lists for as long as they plan to do it.

## Json bookmark / preferences file

The first time this script runs, it creates a json file in `~/.horner_bible_readings.json`.  This file keeps track of your translation preferences and also tracks your the last read chapters bookmark.

This script automatically advances your readings bookmark in the json file at midnight (local time) every time you run the script.

## Readings Configuration

The embedded Bible readings configuration string `BIBLE_YAML` is crucial to the script working. 

`readings_start` and `readings_end` specify the days you want to generate readings for. The script is "clever" enough to generate the correct readings for any day, spitting out readings as if you'd read through each list up until the day specified. So, if you specify a `readings_start` date of 654 the list will output the readings that you would be on if you'd worked through each list for the past 653 days.

### Readings Start & End Examples

The below values would generate the first year of readings.

```yaml
readings_start: 0
readings_end: 365
```

Whereas this example would generate the second year of readings.

```yaml
readings_start: 366
readings_end: 731
```

The script runs very quickly, so you can easily generate 10 years or more of readings in no time.

### Reading Lists

The reading lists are specified under `list_1`, `list_2`, `list_3` and so on up to `list_10`. You can adjust these if need be (some people swap Acts with another book for example, but you need to make sure that the format stays the same as the below.

```yaml
list_n:
    - Book, Number of Chapters
```

## Usage

Run the script as you would any other Python script.

```shell
python horner_readings.py <optional_args>
```

## Output

Choose the output with script arguments.

## -d (daily, default)

You'll get one day's readings, pulled automatically with [`meaningless`](https://pypi.org/project/meaningless/)

## -y (year)

You'll get a list of readings, which you can either take as is, or massage into another format (markdown checkbox list for example).

## Future Improvements

I plan on adding a few styles of output in the future (plain text, csv, markdown etc), and a few different output formats (html, text, pdf, etc).
